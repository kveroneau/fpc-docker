## Various tests and examples for the generated docker images

In this directory you can find examples on how you can easily containerize a Lazarus
program in a Docker container, which can run on either AMD64 or ARM32v7 hardware.

These examples and tests use the images I created on Docker Hub, and do not require
any local images to be created from the **Builder** directory.
